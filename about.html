            <p class="description">This project's purpose is to track the number of attacks as well as to visualize the sources 
                of the attack along with the protocol used to carry out the attack. While current and up to date data on cyber attacks
                is locked behind paywalls, this <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/code/jonathanbouchet/aws-honeypot/data'>AWS honeypot data</a> 
                from 2013 serves as a good case study of global attacks.</p>
            <h1 class="title_text space"><b>Our Vision</b></h1>
            <p class="description">Cyber attacks are a serious issue and will only continue to become more prominent as 
                technology evolves and the Internet of Things (IOT) becomes more widespread. This project hopes to expand 
                on the current body of information by visualizing the relationship between geography and cyber attacks as 
                well as by highlighting cyber attack trends.</p>

            <p class="description" style="margin-top: 50px">Professor Zhao is the foundation our projects and has challenged many of his students, including us, to story-tell through map-making. Utiizing MapBox GL JS, we are tasked to find a topic we are passionate about, and create a story-board or smart dashboard. We have chosen to display our knowledge of smart dashboards and Professor Bo, has provided many resources for us to make use of which includes references to C3 and D3 which will be shown in our map of CyberAttacks.</p>

Steven's hints and advice has allowed us to further comprehend the tasks to create a successful smart dashboard, as well as helping us understand how to reach the solutions to the challenges we've reached along the way. </p>

            <p class="description">Using the AWS Honeypot Attack Data, we wanted to achieve a fully navigational map that changes the bar chart and information being displayed as you zoom in and out and move around the map itself. We focused on the 'proto' variable within the data that classifies the different attack types. 'TCP', 'UDP, and ICMP' are the information being cycled through as you move around the map. While Navigating the map the amount of points displayed on the map will dictate the number of attacks display and the bar chart representatoin as well. Using C3 and D3, we were able to achieve such a feature.</p>
