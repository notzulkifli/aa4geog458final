            <p class="description">This project's purpose is to track the number of attacks as well as to visualize the sources 
                of the attack along with the protocol used to carry out the attack. While current and up to date data on cyber attacks
                is locked behind paywalls, this <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/code/jonathanbouchet/aws-honeypot/data'>AWS honeypot data</a> 
                from 2013 serves as a good case study of global attacks.</p>
            <h1 class="title_text space"><b>Our Vision</b></h1>
            <p class="description">Cyber attacks are a serious issue and will only continue to become more prominent as 
                technology evolves and the Internet of Things (IOT) becomes more widespread. This project hopes to expand 
                on the current body of information by visualizing the relationship between geography and cyber attacks as 
                well as by highlighting cyber attack trends.</p>
